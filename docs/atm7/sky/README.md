# All The Mods 7 - To The Sky

All the Mods 7 To the Sky is the sequel to the popular atm6 sky, we have taken feedback from the first iteration to make this pack the best we have to offer, adding in mods that were not in the first such as **Twilight Forest** and **Alchemistry**, followed by the mod **Ex Machinis**, an automation addon for **Ex Nihilo** built in house by ATM to take you from early, all the way to end game automated resources.

All the Mods started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. 

In All the Mods 7 To the Sky we will continue the tradition adding many new mods whilst keeping to the quality of the first modpack

Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not.
