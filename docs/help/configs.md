# Configs

Pack configs are usually located in the `config/` folder, though others may be in your `world/serverconfigs/` folder.

!!! Warning "When editing configs, please make sure server / client is not running"

    For clients, it's safe to edit `world/serverconfigs/` while not in the world and or restarting entire client.

## F.A.Q

??? Question "Can you make ATM ores minable by quarry?"

    By design, fake players are not allowed to mine ATM ores. This ruins the purpose of the ore being obtained naturally, thus did not come with a config to change.
