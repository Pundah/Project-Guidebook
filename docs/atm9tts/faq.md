???+ Abstract "Gameplay FAQs"
	??? Question "How do I get pebbles? Right clicking dirt doesn't do anything!"
		You need to shift-right click dirt to get pebbles.

	??? Question "How do I get more dirt?"
		- You can put any organic matter (leaves, seeds, saplings, etc.) in the same barrels you use to get witch water.
		- or Hammer some logs and put the chips in the barrel

	??? Question "Is '`item/block name`' EMC-able?"

	??? Question "I'm not getting any silkworms!"
		If you're doing it the right way with a crook, then you might just have really bad RNG. Keep trying.

???+ Warning "Technical FAQs"
	??? Question "Why isn't '`insert name`' mod in ATM9-TTS yet?"
		ATM packs does not literally contain "All The Mods". Our main focus is having mods that's not: 1) buggy, 2) ruins performance or progression. If a mod supports Minecraft version **1.20.1**, and **Forge** (Not NeoForge), you may make a [suggestion](https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-9/issues/1).
		
	??? Question "I found a bug/dupe in the pack. How can I report it?"
		To report bugs, dupes or similar, head over to the [ATM9-TTS GitHub](https://github.com/AllTheMods/All-the-mods-9-Sky/issues) and open a new issue describing the occurrence.
	
	??? Question "I can't complete '`name of quest`' even though I fufilled the requirements?"
		You can enable edit quests in the bottom right of the quest screen (you need OP for this) and then r-click the broken quest and force complete it OR reset it's progress if you still have the items.
		
	??? Question "What are the recommended Java arguments for this pack?"
		- **Client arguments**: send `?args` in the **#bot-spam** channel in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/allthemods).
		- **Server arguments**: send `?svargs` in the **#bot=spam** channel in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/allthemods).

	??? Question "Why does my game crash while launching?"
		Lack of RAM most likely. Send `?allocate` in the **#bot-spam** channel in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/allthemods) to learn how to allocate more RAM. If that's not the problem, head to **#atm9-techsupport** and send `?logs` to see how to upload your crash/latest log.

	??? Question "I crashed and got `Error code 1`, please help"
		`Exit code 1` is a generic error from Minecraft. It is no different than "game didn't load, no longer attempting to load. Please refer to the output error log created by your launcher" if you are unsure... please feel free to ask for further instructions on how to locate, post, and get help for your specific error so that we may further assist you in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/allthemods). Try running `?logs` instead.

	??? Question "I'm having issues connecting to a LAN/Essentials world"
		To fix LAN/Essential some people have removed Logprot, some Oculus, some Supplementaries. None are guaranteed, none are the actual fix. We are unable reproduce it in Dev to properly diagnose it. LAN is highly unstable in big modpacks like these.
