# All The Mods 9

[![](img/atm9TTSLogo.png){.center}](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-9-to-the-sky)

**All The Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. 

**All the Mods 9: To the Sky** is the cap off to the trilogy of sky packs for All The Mods. The team have taken feedback from the first 2 iterations to make this pack the best we have to offer. This pack adds mods that were not in the others such as **Forcecraft**, **Forgiving Void**, **Oreberries**, and **Utilitarian**. We're hoping to make this the most open ended ATM pack yet!

This skyblock pack features **Ex Machinis: Divitiae Deorum**, an automation addon for **Ex Deorum** built in house by ATM to take you from early game all the way to end game automated resources

Does "**All the Mods**" really contain **ALL THE MODS**? No, of course not.
