# F.A.Q

    If your new to modded, allthemods, or minecraft in general, please take a look at our getting started guide.

    Yes, on [CurseForge](README.md)

    Chunkloading is handled by FTB Chunks. Open your map where you claim chunks and once you have a chunk claimed, shift click that same chunk. It should show a red X through the chunk, showing that it is force loaded.

    Look in the in game book Allthemodium or search the ores in JEI and view the tooltips. There is additional information in the Allthemodium book.

??? Question "How do I deal with the Chaos Dragon?"
    The chaos guardian is a multi-phase fight. The crystals can only be damaged by the dragon and it's attacks -or- chaos tier weapons, but the final hit on them will have to come from you to destroy them. Once all the crystals are destroyed, only half the time will it be susceptible to damage, when it doesnt have a blue shield. It has two health bars as well - a red over shield and then its actual HP.
