# Durability Exchange

![](img/durabilityExchange.png){width='350px'}

**Obsidian Sheaders** have over a million durability, but Mahou Tsukai caps durability exchange at like **2,500** durability but the recipe is cheap and easy so that's why I use it since each **Durability Exchange** spell circle can restore a maximum of 10 mana per second, you will need a large amount of spell circles and chests for you to be able to gain the mana you need to efficiently swing your [Morgan](morgan.md) at villagers for damage gain
