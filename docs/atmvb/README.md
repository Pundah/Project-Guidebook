# All The Mods - Volcano Block

All the mods volcano block is a modpack is both a reimagination of the 1.12 Volcanoblock and also the third sieve based modpack following on from 6 and 7 To the Sky.

Multiple resource paths

Sieving isn't for everyone, this is a known problem with skyblock packs so we like to open you up to different resource generation types the further you get into the modpack, from **Ex Machinis**, our built in-house automation mod for ex nihilo, to **Mystical Agriculture** and **Resource Chickens**, and even void miners from **Occultism** and **Industrial Foregoing** you will never be strapped for diamonds, nor be forced towards one path.

In **All the Mods VolcanoBlock** we will continue the tradition adding new mods and removing others to change up the feel, whilst keeping to the quality of the To the Sky series

Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not.
