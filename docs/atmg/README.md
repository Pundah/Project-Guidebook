# All The Mods - Gravitas

## Per aspera ad astra - Through hardships to the stars.

From your early beginnings in this pack, you will be faced with a far different experience than the typical modpack provides. This modpack includes Terrafirmacraft(TFC), which completely overhauls the base Minecraft mechanics, adds dynamic environments with landslides, cave ins and the concept of support beams add an element of danger to mining that extends beyond the monsters you will find underground. An immersive survival experience with detailed world generation with flowing rivers that have an active current, and flow towards oceans, fresh and salt water, Food has an expiration date, and eating it past its date has dire consequences to your health. This pack takes you on a voyage from picking up sticks to craft your first tools, to piloting a rocket to the stars, Can you claw your way to Glacio to locate the stronghold, and face the Ender Dragon?

All the Mods started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. 

Does "All the Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not. Especially not this pack.
