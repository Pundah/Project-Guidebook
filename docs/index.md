# Welcome!

To the new **Project-W Guides**, by **Pundah**.

This guide is currently a work in progress, so there will be missing/placeholder information. Want to contribute? Check [Project-W Guides Contributing](guides/contributing/README.md)

???+ Tip "Project-W Guides is only for our packs"
    Project-W has custom changes and additions, mostly recipes. This means it's only for the Project-W pack, and may not be the same for other packs. However, guides in the [Additional Guides](guides/README.md) should work for any pack with said mod.

## Intro

Are you new to **Minecraft**, **Project-W**, or just need help getting started? Here you'll find some **Tips** and **Guides** on getting started with **Project-W**!

### Getting Started

**Project-W** packs require a PC that has at least **12GB** or more system RAM :material-information-outline:{ title="Random Access Memory" } for the best <u>_playable_</u> experience.

Allocating between **6-8GB** RAM is required for Project-W. This <u>must</u> be changed within [Launcher](#launchers) settings. **6GB** minimum is **recommended**.

### Requirements

- [x] An official **Mojang** / **Microsoft** account for **Java Edition**.
- [x] A third-party [launcher](#launchers) that can download, install, and run Project-W.
- [x] A PC with at least **12GB** or more **RAM**. :material-information-outline:{ title="Random Allocated Memory" }

### Launchers

The most common launchers are [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app), [FTB App](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/ftb-app), [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/), [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) and [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/en/). You will need one of these launchers to install packs. Sign into your **Microsoft** account and search for the modpack of your choice to install.

!!! Info "Allocation"

    By default, in the launcher or instance (modpack) settings, **4GB** is allocated. **Recommended** MAX allocation is **8-12GB** | `8192-12288`Mb. You should **never** allocate all of or more RAM than necessary.

    Additionally, some launchers may install and use the appropriate version of [Java](help/java.md), though make sure you're using the correct version of [Java](help/java.md) for the **Minecraft** version of the pack installed.
