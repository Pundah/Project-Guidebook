???+ Info "Special Generators"

    | Generator | Change | Notes |
    | --------- | ------- | ------- |
    | **Enchantment** | {~~ 40 ~> 500 ~~} RF/t |
    | **Magmatic** | {~~ 40 ~> 150 ~~} RF/t |
    | **Ender** | {~~ 40/80 ~> 300/500 ~~} RF/t | **Ender Pearl** or **Eye of Ender** -> {~~ 300 ~> 500 ~~} RF/t. 
    | **Culinary** | {~~ 8 ~> 10 ~~} RF/t | **ATM Carrot** currently generates 320 RF/t. This would make it 400 RF/t per carrot, which is fair. 
    | **Halitosis** | {~~ 40 ~> 1k ~~} RF/t | Only way to automate **Dragon's Breath** is HNN. Nerf overall RF given from {~~ 480k ~> 200k ~~}.
    | **NetherStar** | {~~ 4k ~> 10k ~~}RF/t | Tons of Nether Stars are needed for the star, so choosing this gen should be worth it.
