# Mahou Tsukai

**Mahou Tsukai** is a magic mod focused mainly on spell uniqueness and special effects, instead of focusing on how spells are created, as many magic mods do. Many of the spells are based on similar concepts in Fate/Stay Night and other media, but knowledge of these media are not at all necessary to understand and enjoy the mod. 

## ATM9 Mahou Changes

- **Innate Cap** is set to a maximum of 5000.
- Increasing **Innate Cap** requires throwing **Ender Upgrade Orbs** (26 max) in Mahou lake along with **Caliburn** in a _single throw_. 
- Converting **Caliburn** to **Morgan** requires killing the **Warden** with **Caliburn**.

!!! note ""
    You must throw Caliburn into the lake with all Ender Upgrade Orbs you plan to use at the same time in a single throw. You only have one chance to increase the Innate Cap. 
    If for example you only throw 10 Ender Upgrade Orbs and Caliburn into the lake, then later throw 16 (for a total of 26) in the lake with Caliburn it will not accept the remaining 16 Ender Upgrade Orbs. If this happens you need to make a new Caliburn.
